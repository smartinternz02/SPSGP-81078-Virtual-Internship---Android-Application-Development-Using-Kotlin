# Grocery App
The objective of the project to make an app user friendly to user.
In this project, we are using MVVM (Model View ViewModel) for architectural patterns, Room for database, Coroutines and RecyclerView to display the list of items.

### MVVM (Model View ViewModel)
MVVM architecture in android is used to give structure to the project’s code and understand code easily. MVVM is an architectural design pattern in android. MVVM treat Activity classes and XML files as View. This design pattern completely separate UI from its logic. Here is an image to quickly understand MVVM.
### ROOM DataBase
Room persistence library is a database management library and it is used to store the data of apps like grocery item name, grocery item quantity, and grocery item price. Room is a cover layer on SQLite which helps to perform the operation on the database easily.
 
### RecycleView
RecyclerView is a container and it is used to display the collection of data in a large amount of data set that can be scrolled very effectively by maintaining a limited number of views.

### Coroutines
Coroutines are a lightweight thread, we use a coroutine to perform an operation on other threads, by this our main thread doesn’t block and our app doesn’t crash.

### 5. Kotlin
Kotlin is a programming language that can run on JVM. Google has announced Kotlin as one of its officially supported programming languages in Android Studio. Kotlin is a modern statically typed programming language used by over 60% of professional Android developers that helps boost productivity, developer satisfaction, and code safety.
### 6. Android Studio
Android Studio is the official integrated development environment for Google's Android operating system, built on JetBrains' IntelliJ IDEA software and designed specifically for Android development. It is available for download on Windows, macOS and Linux based operating systems.
